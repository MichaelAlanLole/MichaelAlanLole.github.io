            <p>I think my layouts have been reliable and well-designed throughout this assignment. Even though I wanted to give the website's design more thought, I lacked the technical knowledge to make it happen. To ensure that I am better equipped to produce a more interactive and creative product for any upcoming jobs, I will be developing this. Although there was a lot more I could have done with the layout of my present website, I am still happy with the end result. Although it tends to break on smaller screen sizes, the layout of my website's biggest issue is its lack of device flexibility. The reason for this is I could not figure out how to create a fully flexible website that can react to different screen sizes and adjust. This is a major problem, and it is my main goal to overcome this problem in preparation for future assignments.<br><br> 

                The website's colour choice, while simple, gives it a polished appearance and makes all material visible and understandable. But as I move forward, I want to learn more about various colour schemes, how to employ them, and how they might help me create better designs. The same is true of my typography; I only employed straightforward methods, which resulted in a straightforward finish. I must improve this ability because I will need to be able to use typography in a variety of creative ways when creating more advanced websites.<br><br> 
                
                Different forms of media, like audio messages or videos, can alter how a website is viewed and used. I did not take advantage of this by adding any videos or audio to my website, which resulted in a less interactive, more straightforward result. If I were to attempt this again, I would work harder to produce original ways to include these and make them compatible with my website. Put videos of the poster creation process and the rationale behind my decisions, for instance, on the homepage of the website.<br><br> 
                
                Despite my navigation bar being useful and attractive, I want to add more animation and experiment with navigation methods besides a straightforward bar the next time. By using anchor links, I could have added additional navigation to my website and let visitors jump to whatever location on the page they wished. The navigation of my website would have been more effective and efficient with these anchor connections. However, I am pleased with the way the navigation bar looks and works, and I am eager to improve for the next time.<br><br> 
                
                Overall, my website accomplishes the functional aim I set out to accomplish, but the visual design could have used a little more imagination and planning. I hope to learn from this project and raise the bar on my design and website-building abilities going forward. To improve my future efforts, I want to be able to use a variety of media types and interactivity methods. </p>
