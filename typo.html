            <ul>
                <li><img src="Artboard 1.png" alt="aixal artboard"></li>
                <li><h3>Axial</h3><p>Axial typography is text that is on an axis. What I mean by this is that the text follows an imaginary line, which acts as the axis. Axial typography does not have to be symmetrical and does not have to follow one single axis. For example, an axis can break off from another one like how a tree has branches that all break off from a single branch. As you can see from my example the text follows a single axis and swaps back and forth from each side of the axis. There is a lot you can do with axial typography, and it has many uses. </p></li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><img src="Artboard 2.png" alt="radial artboard"></li>
                <li><h3>Radial</h3><p>Radial typography is text that radiates from one point, for example a circle. This has many uses and is used frequently in web development for example. As you can see from my example, the text radiates around the circle following the curve of the circle. Radial typography does not always have to be around a shape, it could be inside the shape also. The problem with radial text is that it can make text harder to read depending on the rotation of the text. Therefore it is best to use radial typography sparingly to ensure that the text is still readable and not clustered together. </p></li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><img src="Artboard 3.png" alt="dilatational artboard"></li>
                <li><h3>Dilatational</h3><p>Dilatational typography is like radial typography as it they both follow points. The difference between the two is that dilatational follows a path around a point. As you can see from my example the text follows a circular path around a point rather than coming out of a point. This is the key difference between the two. Dilatational shares the same readability problem that radial has, depending on the angle the text could be rotated 90 degrees making text extremely hard to read. </p></li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><img src="Artboard 4.png" alt="random artboard"></li>
                <li><h3>Random</h3><p>Random typography is what it says, its content gives the style of pure randomness. This type of typography is very niche and rarely used due to it being very useless. As you can see from my example the text is placed randomly across the page, the size and angle of the font is random, and the order of the text is also random. This makes the text extremely hard to read and is like a puzzle to understand what it's saying. There are some uses for this though if you can get creative with it. </p></li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><img src="Artboard 5.png" alt="grid artboard"></li>
                <li><h3>Grid</h3><p>Grid typography is one of the most used layout systems by designers and some use it exclusively above all other systems. How grid typography works is how it sounds, a grid is used to set Collums and rows that text can be put in. This type of typography is extremely diverse as it could be used for anything making it highly suitable for whatever you need it for. As you can see from my example the text boxes follow the Collums in the grid. There are no readability issues with this type of typography due to it being so simple and putting the text first. </p></li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><img src="Artboard 6.png" alt="modular artboard"></li>
                <li><h3>Modular</h3><p>Modular typography is remarkably similar to how a grid layout works, it works by using repeating structures to break up content on the page. This can be used with a grid or without a grid, it is completely up to the designer. Unlike a grid they do not have to follow how a grid works, content can be placed anywhere on the page and can be completely unsymmetrical. It is a more unique version of the grid typography. </p></li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><img src="Artboard 7.png" alt="transitional artboard"></li>
                <li><h3>Transitional</h3><p>Transitional typography is one of the least suitable types of typography, the reason for this is because of the strange layout and unprofessional aesthetic. How it works is by following a line and having multiple layers of text. The direction of the text does not have to be straight it can also be diagonal. There is a lot that you can do with transitional due to how customizable it is. The main use for this typography would be informal posters and this is the only real use due to how unprofessional it looks. Depending on how you use this type can make the text completely readable or very confusing to read. </p></li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><img src="Artboard 8.png" alt="bilateral artboard"></li>
                <li><h3>Bilateral</h3><p>Bilateral typography in a nutshell means centered, it is based around symmetry and centered text. Personally, I think bilateral is a very boring type of typography and is very unimaginative creating a simple, boring layout. As you can see from my example It does not have to be straight, it can be on an angle and spaced out however you feel like. This type of typography is very readable and easy to understand but that is about the only advantage of using this. </p></li>
